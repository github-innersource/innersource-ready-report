# Innersource-Ready-Report

A GitHub App to prepare your Project for Innersource registration, based on configured requirements. 

It produces an `Innersource Ready Report`, which will be added as a `Repo Issue` and in addition a `JSON formatted report` will be send to a persistent storage (configurable).

---

- **What does that mean ?**

We are providing **a self-service process** for developers to promote their application to Innersource. The process contains the following...

![process](docs/images/process-steps.png)

- The App evaluates a Repo that is 'marked' for InnerSourcing, to be compliant with configured requirements.

- The App creates an `InnerSource Ready Report` within the Repo, listing all required Repo settings and their compliance.

- In case a Repo is not compliant, the user can *'fix'* the required settings and re-run the compliance check (Issue-Ops Comment: `/check`).

- When all InnerSource requirements are met, the App sends the `InnerSource Ready Report` to a InnerSource registration service.
